- The compile_commands setting has been implemented as a linter setting:

    This makes it more consistent with the other possible settings and also
    allows to access the home directory by using ~ in the path.

    To use the new setting, edit your project settings and rename the previous
    "compile_commands" to "SublimeLinter.linters.clangtidy.compile_commands".

    The old setting will still work the same as before.
